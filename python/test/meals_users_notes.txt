no labels ( see example of labels in tagged post txt )
see how it's done in input.txt 
and then user test will just be a passed in string of ingredients tab spaced i believe
MAYBE in rows like meals but not sure all that can be tested against...

So are the meal embeddings alone important?
Or should we just only embed the ones that have been swiped like the content-based recommendation part of the paper suggest?

just test results for both I suppose.

**If we go pure menu embedding it looks like this, where each row is a meal** (for these cleaning steps, did it all in excel)

og files looked like: 
['jalapeno chilies', 'lemon', 'dried oregano', 'olive oil', 'garlic', 'boneless skinless chicken breasts']
['boneless center cut pork chops', 'salt', 'ground black pepper', 'olive oil', 'balsamic vinegar', 'sugar']
['ground chicken', 'avocado', 'chopped garlic', 'panko', 'jalapeno chilies', 'salt', 'pepper']
['steak', 'eggs', 'buttermilk', 'flour', 'vegetable oil', 'whole milk', 'pan drippings']
['ground beef', 'eggs', 'salt', 'ground black pepper', 'seasoned bread crumbs', 'worcestershire sauce']

**If we go pure user embedding based on swipes it looks like this, where each row is a user**
This one seems more in line with the content based recs of the paper 
But less in line with Jack suggestions and seems like it severely limits the amount of info you use to start 
(in fairness, while this one is harder to bootstrap, if it works better, that's a good thing for building a moat)

user1  ingredient1meal1 ingredient2meal1 <tab> ingredient1meal2 ingredient2meal2
user2

Do the meal split, versus the full ingredient bag of words for the user? Just try all of these and see what the results are.
** Note that you'll need to restore the database backup to split out to meals again because I aggregated for users.

Or just use the current agg I have for user: 

user1 ingredient1 ingredient2 ... (no meal splits)
user2 ingredient1 ingredient2 ...
